I'm restoring my first home computer, a 1979 [Exidy Sorcerer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exidy_Sorcerer). I discovered a fault with one of the 2KB programmable read-only memory (PROM) chips; it had lost its memory and become blank. Terry Stewart had an identical problem, so I won't describe the [fault diagnosis process that he has documented so thoroughly](https://www.classic-computers.org.nz/blog/2011-06-25-sorcerer-rom-pac-fix-part-1.htm).

The result was that I needed to source EPROMS, more-or-less compatible with the 2716 pin layout, as well as a UV EPROM eraser and an EPROM programmmer. I researched numerous articles, and watched many videoS, and while I learned a lot, I was also left with the feeling this is a minefield. Because 2716-type devices have not been manufactured for many years, there is great suspicion in the marketplace. Which chips are genuine and which are fake? Which chips are compatible with which programmers?

I won't add to the ethical and economic debate about the veracity o fthe available chips, but simply relate my experiences which were more painless than I feared.

### Programmer
I bought a [TL866 II Plus Universal Programmer](http://xgecu.com/TL866_main.html) from a UK-based ebay seller named [yourcartmax](https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/yourcartmax) for Â£41. It was the cheapest UK-based offering. THere are claims that these devices have been conterfeited, but also that the presence of a label on the bottom of the machine is suggestive of a genuine item. Here's the label on mine. I have no reason to doubt its authenticity. 

The programmer comes with software for Windows on a CD, but more recent updates are available via the [xgecu website](http://xgecu.com/). At the time of writing the latest is 10.31. You are instructed to install the software before plugging in the programmer to a USB port, so that drivers are available. Once again the fear, uncertainty and doubt is rife regarding this software. A thread indicates that six different anti-virus products detect malware. I checked it with Avast, and nothing untoward was detected.

I used a rear USB port on the elderly Dell desktop machine on which I run Windows, on hearsay grounds that the rear ports deliver more current to USB. Programming EPROMs does demand higher voltages than USB's 5V, so the programmer may be impacted by current-limited USB ports. Some people recommend a powered USB hub but I don't have one. More on this later.

### Eraser
EPROMs can be erased and reprogrammed. Erasure requires exposure to light in the UVC range, ideally 254nm. There are cheap Chinese-origin plastic boxes containing a mercury vapour tube, and a little electronics, which promise to do the job. There is also lots of chatter on the boards about erasing with sunlight (you can but it takes weeks instead of minutes), toothbrush santisers, UV LEDs at close range (the lowest wavelength available from LEDs at this time seems to be 365nm, so less effective), and the usual claim that the Chinese devices are crap and you really need a used, elderly device from eBay. With my spinning from all the options, I ended up buying a [cheap Chinese device from Banggood](https://uk.banggood.com/NEW-High-Speed-Ultraviolet-Eraser-UV-EPROM-Eraser-Ultraviolet-Light-Erasable-Timer-p-1532425.html) for $22. Banggood seem to get things to me a bit quicker than Aliexpress, and my biggest worry was receiving a box full of broken glass and mercury droplets like that poor fellow. Luckily all arrived intact nine days after ordering.
