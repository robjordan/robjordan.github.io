  After 30+ years as a software developer, IT architect, consultant and 
  lecturer, I'm now fully-retired and back to my roots, meddling with software 
  and electronics as a hobby.

  This site highlights some of my projects and discoveries. All of my code and designs can be found in my GitHub site, linked in the footer.
